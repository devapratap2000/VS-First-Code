  <h2>Commit your life to God</h2>
  <p>A song of ascents. (Psam 128)
    1 Blessed are all who fear the Lord,
        who walk in obedience to him.
    2 You will eat the fruit of your labor;
        blessings and prosperity will be yours.
    3 Your wife will be like a fruitful vine
        within your house;
    your children will be like olive shoots
        around your table.
    4 Yes, this will be the blessing
        for the man who fears the Lord.
    
    5 May the Lord bless you from Zion;
        may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem
        all the days of your life.
    6 May you live to see your children’s children—
        peace be on Israel.</p>
